# advent of code (in [`alethe`][alethe])

Taking [`alethe`][alethe] out for a test-spin...

- `lib.al`: mostly implementation of (arbitrary precision) binary arithmetic, as the numbers in AOC can be _quite_ large making the Peano arithmetic in the 'official' [standard library][alethe-ex] impractical
- `aoc.al`: some more 'library' code, but mostly the aoc solutions; these aren't necessarily optimal from a golfing perspective, let alone a speed perspective...
